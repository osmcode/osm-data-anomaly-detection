#
#  Disabled checks:
#
#  cppcoreguidelines-owning-memory
#    We don't want to use the GSL library.
#
#  cppcoreguidelines-pro-bounds-array-to-pointer-decay
#    Limited use and many false positives including for all asserts.
#
#  cppcoreguidelines-pro-bounds-pointer-arithmetic
#    Difficult to get by without it...
#
#  cppcoreguidelines-pro-type-static-cast-downcast
#    This is needed and totally okay if we are sure about the types.
#
#  cppcoreguidelines-pro-type-vararg
#    We need some of these functions at least and for some functions it isn't
#    even clear that those are vararg functions.
#
#  fuchsia-*
#    Much too strict.
#
#  google-runtime-references
#    This is just a matter of preference.
#
#  hicpp-no-array-decay
#    Alias for cppcoreguidelines-pro-bounds-array-to-pointer-decay.
#
#  hicpp-vararg
#    Too strict, sometimes calling vararg functions is necessary.
#
#  readability-implicit-bool-conversion
#    I don't think this makes the code more readable.
